# DeployEx

> Who supervises the supervisor (of your application)?

![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-Development%20v0.9.x-blue) [![Build Status](https://github.com/thiagoesteves/deployex/workflows/Deployex%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thiagoesteves/deployex/actions/workflows/pr-ci.yml)

DeployEx is a lightweight tool designed for managing deployments for Beam applications (Elixir, Gleam and Erlang) without relying on additional deployment tools like Docker or Kubernetes. Its primary goal is to utilize the release package for executing full deployments or hot-upgrades, depending on the package's content, while leveraging OTP distribution for monitoring and data extraction.

DeployEx acts as a central deployment runner, gathering crucial deployment data such as the current version and release package contents. The content of the release package enables it to run for a full deployment or a hot-upgrade. Meanwhile, on the development front, your CI/CD pipeline takes charge of crafting and updating packages for the target release. This integration ensures that DeployEx is always equipped with the latest packages, ready to facilitate deployments.

To learn more about DeployEx and the advantages of removing containerized abstractions from your deployment process, check out the talk [Bring back the power of Beam deployments with DeployEx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV4ROe6xmlI) at CODE BEAM America 2025.

## 🔉 Features

- Monitors multiple Beam application nodes (Elixir/Erlang/Gleam) and automatically restarts them if they crash for any reason.
- Includes a backoff delay restart mechanism to prevent excessive restarts.
- Performs full deployments based solely on the release files generated by:
  - `mix release` for Elixir.
  - `gleam export` for Gleam.
  - `rebar3 as prod tar` for Erlang.
- Supports hot code reloading for:
  - Elixir application (and libraries) using the [Jellyfish][jyf] library.

## ⚠️ What is coming next? 

[Roadmap](https://github.com/users/thiagoesteves/projects/4)

## 📁 Getting Started

Since OTP distribution is heavily used between the DeployEx and Monitored Applications, users must ensure that both applications are running the same OTP Major version to prevent compatibility issues and system malfunctions. DeployEx releases will contain binaries for the following OTP versions:

| DeployEx version                                                          | <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OTP-27-green.svg"/> | <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OTP-28-green.svg"/> |

- **[1]** - Binaries for `OTP-28` are compiled with Elixir [1.18.4-otp-27](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/releases/tag/v1.18.4)

### Running the application

You can kickstart the setup with the following commands, the default number of replicas is 3:

```bash
mix deps.get
iex --sname deployex --cookie cookie -S mix phx.server
Erlang/OTP 28 [erts-16.1.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:10:10] [ds:10:10:10] [async-threads:1] [jit]

```

Now you can visit [`localhost:5001`](http://localhost:5001) from your browser and enter the credentials for the admin user, _**username: admin password: deployex**_. You should expect the following dashboard:

![Empty Dashboard](guides/static/deployex_no_monitoring_app.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The error message in the CLI is due to no monitored app is available to be deployed. If you want to proceed for a local test, follow the steps at [Running DeployEx and Monitored app locally](https://github.com/thiagoesteves/deployex/tree/thi/add-erlang-hot-upgrade-support?tab=readme-ov-file#-running-deployex-locally). Also, it is important to note that the distribution will be required so this is the reason to add `-sname deployex` in the command

### How DeployEx handles monitored application Version/Release

The DeployEx app expects a `current.json` file to be available, which contains version, hash information and any pre-command. This file is mandatory for full deployment and hot upgrades.

#### Version file (current.json)

Expected location in the release folder:

```bash
# production path
./{bucket}/versions/{monitored_app}/{env}/current.json
# local test path
/tmp/deployex/bucket/versions/{monitored_app}/{env}/current.json
```

Expected JSON format for `current.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "pre_commands": ["eval MyApp.Migrator.create", "eval MyApp.Migrator.migrate"], // optional field
  "hash": "local"
}
```

Once the file is captured, the deployment will start if no app is running or if the current app is running with a version that differs from the `current.json` file.

#### Release package

Expected location in the release folder:

```bash
# production path
./{bucket}/dist/{monitored_app}/{monitored_app}-{version}.tar.gz
# local test path
/tmp/deployex/bucket/dist/{monitored_app}/{monitored_app}-{version}.tar.gz
```

## 🛠️ Production Information

### Environment Variables

DeployEx application typically requires a few environment variables to be defined for proper operation. Ensure that you have the following environment variables set when running in production:

| ENV NAME                           | EXAMPLE                          |             SOURCE | DESCRIPTION                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -----------------: | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DEPLOYEX_SECRET_KEY_BASE**       | 42otsNl...Fpq3dIJ02              | aws, gcp or env secrets | secret key used for encryption                            |
| **DEPLOYEX_ERLANG_COOKIE**         | cookie                           | aws, gcp or env secrets | erlang cookie                                             |
| **DEPLOYEX_ADMIN_HASHED_PASSWORD** | 2b1...42ASi                      | aws, gcp or env secrets | Hashed admin password for authentication                  |
| **DEPLOYEX_CONFIG_YAML_PATH**      | /home/ubuntu/deployex.yaml       |         system ENV      | Yaml configuration for Deployex and Monitored application |
| **DEPLOYEX_OTP_TLS_CERT_PATH**     | /usr/local/share/ca-certificates |         system ENV      | If using mTLS, the certificate PATH is needed             |

Once DeployEx runs, it fetches the configuration from the YAML file described in the session [YAML Management](guides/docs/yaml/README.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For local testing, these variables are not expected or set to default values.

### ☁️ Cloud Providers

DeployEx offers a comprehensive set of Terraform examples for programmatically deploying in AWS and GCP, including detailed step-by-step setup instructions:

- [AWS deployment for Elixir](guides/docs/aws-elixir/README.md)
- [GCP deployment for Elixir](guides/docs/gcp-elixir/README.md)
- [AWS deployment for Gleam](guides/docs/aws-gleam/README.md)

### Installation

If you intend to install DeployEx directly on an Ubuntu/Debian server, you can utilize the [deployex script](/devops/installer/deployex.sh) provided in the release package. This script is able to `install`, `update` and `hot-upgrade` DeployEx. However, you have the option to manually compile and install DeployEx on your target system.

For more information, please check [YAML Management](guides/docs/yaml/README.md) details.

#### 🔥 Hot-Upgrades

For more information, please check [Hot-Upgrades](guides/docs/hot-upgrades/README.md) details.

### Pre-commands (Elixir only)

Your application will likely require database commands, such as migrations. DeployEx handles these through pre-commands specified in `current.json` under the `pre_commands` field. These commands will be executed in the order they are listed, before the application starts. If a pre-command is needed and does not require changes to the application itself, using pre-commands in conjunction with hotupgrade is ideal to avoid unnecessary downtime.

### 🔐 Secrets Requirements

DeployEx retrieves its secrets from a Secret Manager (AWS, GCP, or local) through the config provider. The configuration requires specifying the adapter and the secret path. These information is set via the [YAML File](guides/docs/yaml/README.md), For example:

```yaml
# Secrets Management
secrets_adapter: "aws"                                   # Secrets adapter: aws, gcp or env
secrets_path: "deployex-myphoenixapp-prod-secrets"       # Secret path to retrieve from
```

Within the secrets, the following key-value pairs are required:
| ENV NAME | EXAMPLE | DESCRIPTION |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **DEPLOYEX_SECRET_KEY_BASE** | 42otsNl...Fpq3dIJ02 | mix phx.gen.secret |
| **DEPLOYEX_ERLANG_COOKIE** | my-cookie | erlang cookie |
| **DEPLOYEX_ADMIN_HASHED_PASSWORD** | $2b$1...5PAYTZjNQ42ASi | Bcrypt.hash_pwd_salt("my-pass") |

## ❓How DeployEx handles services

DeployEx operates by monitoring applications and versions using folders and files, treating the monitored app as a service:

```bash
# test environment
/tmp/deployex/varlib/service/${monitored_app}/${sname}/previous/${monitored_app}
/tmp/deployex/varlib/service/${monitored_app}/${sname}/new/${monitored_app}
/tmp/deployex/varlib/service/${monitored_app}/${sname}/current/${monitored_app}
```

```bash
# production environment
/var/lib/deployex/service/${monitored_app}/${sname}/previous/${monitored_app}
/var/lib/deployex/service/${monitored_app}/${sname}/new/${monitored_app}
/var/lib/deployex/service/${monitored_app}/${sname}/current/${monitored_app}
```
