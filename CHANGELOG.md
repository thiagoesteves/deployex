# CHANGELOG (0.6.x)

## :soon: 0.7.0 ()

### Backwards incompatible changes for 0.6.1

#### Configuration Update Required: Replica Port Definition

The `initial_port` field has been replaced with a simpler `replica_ports` configuration to support dynamic port assignment for replicas.

**Before (0.6.0 and earlier):**
```yaml
applications:
    initial_port: 4000
```
**After (0.7.0):**
```yaml
applications:
    replica_ports:
      - key: PORT
        base: 4000
```
