    What is DeployEx?
  </h1>
  <p class="text-white text-lg mb-8 ml-5 mr-5">
    Deployex is a lightweight tool designed for managing deployments in Elixir applications
    without relying on additional deployment tools like Docker or Kubernetes. Its primary goal
    is to utilize the mix release package for executing full deployments or hot-upgrades,
    depending on the package's content, while leveraging OTP distribution for monitoring and
    data extraction. Deployex acts as a central deployment runner, gathering crucial deployment
    data such as the current version and release package contents. The content of the release
    package enables it to run for a full deployment or a hot-upgrade. Meanwhile, on the
    evelopment front, your CI/CD pipeline takes charge of crafting and updating packages
    for the target release. This integration ensures that Deployex is always equipped with
    the latest packages, ready to facilitate deployments. If you wanna know more about it,
